/*
 
    In Java, the heap memory is used for allocating objects, and creating new instances of the String class in a loop like this will indeed consume heap memory. However, this code creates very lightweight and short-lived String objects, which are eligible for garbage collection almost immediately after they are created.

    As a result, the memory used for these short-lived String objects will be quickly released by the garbage collector, and the heap memory will not be exhausted by this code.

    If you were to perform operations that continuously create and retain large objects in memory, or if you were to create objects in a very tight loop without ever releasing them, then you might eventually run into a "HeapOverflow" (OutOfMemoryError) situation. However, this specific code, as given, is not likely to cause a "HeapOverflow" error because the objects it creates are minimal and short-lived.
